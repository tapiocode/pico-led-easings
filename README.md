# LED Easings

LED easings for Raspberry Pi Pico by using PWM and easing functions. Implementing some functions described at [easings.net](https://easings.net).

## Usage

See [pico_led_easings.h](pico_led_easings.h) for available easing functions.

See [main.c](main.c) for usage example demo.

For quick demo just drop [pico_led_easings.uf2](pico_led_easings.uf2) into your regular Pico (non W).

Optionally, if you have an RGB LED (common cathode), wire it up to pins 16, 17, 18, and GND. In fact, a regular LED works too with any of said pins.
